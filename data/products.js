      description: "Expanded polystyrene (EPS) geofoam is a lightweight geotechnical material which reduces the loads imposed on adjacent and underlying soils and structures. Traditional earth materials are heavy and can cause settlement, instability or lateral pressures. Other lightweight fill materials are variable in their makeup and are not engineered, due to field execution variables. EPS Geofoam is among the most versatile lightweight materials available. EPS Geofoam maximizes onsite installation efficiency. EPS Geofoam significantly reduces axial loads on weaker sub-soils while concurrently reducing or eliminating lateral loads on abutments and foundations. EPS Geofoam can arrive at the job site prefabricated and ready to place. It is easily inventoried and handled. Installation is not delayed by weather. Advantages of Using Geofoam: Extremely light weight reduces lateral or bearing loads, Predicable engineered performance, Can be installed in various weather conditions, Maximizes Installation Efficiency, Various densities available to meet strength requirements, Cost-Effective Solution.",

      description: "EPS Thermocol Foam Patterns for Lost Foam Investment Casting • Biggest facility for making Pattern size upto 20’x4’x2’ • Patterns best for Investment casting of MS & CI • In house facility for 3D Designing, Scanning, Prototyping and Pattern Development. Foam patterns can be made by two methods: 1) CNC Machine Patterns - Patterns of Linear shapes can be made easily, we fabricate patterns by gluing together simple shapes to build up a complex pattern. This process of making patterns is cheap and fast and does not require Die making. (This method is best for pattern prototyping) 2) Foam Pattern Moulding - Die made Patterns by Injection Moulding - Tooling is composed of a split-cavity machined aluminum die that is the negative mold from which the foam pattern is produced. The tooling is highly specialized. These are permanent Mold for making Lost foam patterns. Thermocol Patterns, EPS pattern, Thermocol Lost foam casting",

What’s STMMAAn expandable co-polymer resin bead made from styrene and MMA monomers. STMMA has a lower carbon content than EPS, and is used to make foam patterns in lost foam casting. STMMA can reduce defects in castings, lower energy costs, and increase productivity.",
